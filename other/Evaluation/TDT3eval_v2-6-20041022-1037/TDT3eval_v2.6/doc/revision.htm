The follow is the revision history for the TDT3eval package.  The
TDT3eval package is the successor to the TDT2eval package.  The <a
HREF="revision_tdt2.htm">TDT2 revision log</a> contains the history of
the TDT2eval package.


<P>
<h1> Version 1.0, Released May 21, 1999 </h1>
Programs have been converted to following TDT3 filenames:
<DIR>
	<table border=2>
	<tr> <th> TDT2 Name <TH> TDT3 Name
	<TR> <TD> TDT2BuildIndex.pl <TD> TDT3BuildIndex.pl

The following changes have been made since TDT2eval Version 0.6. 

<DIR>
<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR> <TD> TDT3.pm <TD>
        <UL>
	<li> Added "use strict" to improve error checking. 
	<li> Converted all glob aliases to references.
	<LI> Added code to the topic relevance table loader to make sure there is only one entry for a topic/document annotation.  Version 0.6 did not do this check and as a consequence, some documents were improperly ignored during scoring.  This will slightly change the detection performance.
	<LI> Corrected problems with the automatic boundary scoring procedures.  The mapping function to map story decisions onto the reference story segmentation was making mistakes. 
	<OL> <LI> On the next to the last hyp story, if it occurred before the last reference story boundary, that mapping was incorrect,
	     <LI> For a reference story with multiple hypothesis story units, (at least three stories), the mapped hypothesis cluster was always the last story within the reference story boundaries.
	</OL>
	<LI> Changed the tracking scoring structure to be more memory efficient.
        </UL>
<TR> <TD> TDT3seg.pl <TD> 
        <UL>
	<li> Added "use strict" to improve error checking. 
	<li> Converted all glob aliases to references.
	<LI> Relaxed the checking of system output deferral times.  Warnings are printed rather that fatal errors.
	<li> Modified the accepted index file format.  There are additional fields that specify the source file and language conditions of the test.
	<LI> Modified the default evaluation frame size to be 75 IFF the evaluation source language is Mandarin and the POINTER type is a recid.
	<LI> For the evaluation of Mandarin ASR, the RECIDs are in terms of words, but the evaluation frame size for Mandarin is in terms of characters.  Therefore, the program converts the word-based RECIDs into character-bases RECIDs by reading the tokenized text file.
	</UL>
<TR> <TD> TDT3det.pl <TD> 
	<UL>
	<li> Added "use strict" to improve error checking. 
	<li> Converted all glob aliases to references.
	<LI> Added a  -S option to define independent subsets over which scores are computed.  
	<LI> Modified the summary report it include story weighted Pmiss, Pfa and Cdet.
	<LI> Added the computation of Cost Weighted YDZ metrics.
	<li> Designated primary evaluation metric.
	<LI> Relaxed the checking of system output deferral periods.  Warnings are printed rather that fatal errors.
	<li> Modifications to TDT3.pm changed the scoring of the 1998 TDT2 evaluation.  This document documents the changes in detection performance <a HREF="v06-v10.htm">between TDT2eval V0.6 and TDT3eval V1.0</A>
	<li> Defined MACROs for common topic sets.  These macros can be used with the -T option to specify topic sets.
	</UL>
<TR> <TD> TDT3trk.pl <TD> 
        <UL>
	<li> Added "use strict" to improve error checking. 
	<li> Converted all glob aliases to references.
	<LI> Modified the storage structure for the scores of each document to be more memory efficient. The structure is an array, rather than a hash list, but there is a hash table to tell what values the array cells correspond to.
	<li> Designate primary evaluation metric.
	<li> Topic weighted DET curves are now an option.
	<li> The problem with mapping automatic story boundaries onto reference story boundaries does change the results of the '98 TDT2 evaluation.  The overall scores for the CMU no boundary test changed as follows:
	<table border=2>
	<tr> <TH> Metric </TH> <TH> TDT2eval_v0.6 </TH> <TH> TDT3eval_v1.0 </TH> </TR>

<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR> <TD> TDT3.pm <TD>
        <UL>
	<li> Reduced the number of computations for the DET plots.  The previous DET plots computed a point for each document.  The new plot computes a point when one of two conditions occur:
	  <OL> <LI> the next highest scoring point is an "on topic", or
	       <LI> the next highest scoring point is "off topic", but the following point is "on topic".
	  </OL>
	  Condition 2 preserves the "step" structure of the graphs so that the graphs look identical.  
	  <P> When using 1.3 score tracking results of the first 1999 dry run, there was a 66% reduction in DET computation runtime, for an overall reduction of 55%.  In terms of disk space for the DET plots, there was a 99% reduction from 128Mb to 1.8Mb.  In terms of RAM during execution, version 1.3 used 300 Mb, while version 1.2 used 718 Mb

This was acceptable unless topics existed with no "on-topic" stories in the test set.  The formulation was changed to use the average of the topics Pmiss statistics and the average of the topic Pfa statistics.

<UL> 	<li> Make DET curves import able into powerpoint.
	<li> Make DET curve scale a command line configuration.
	<li> Make a new script EditDET.pl That can combine DET curves, 
		add points to curves,  and add annotations at specific points
	<li> The programs open and close stdout which needs to be fixed.
	<li> Check file order of submissions, make sure only one place in file.

<dir>
The TDT3BuildIndex.pl program only builds the default index files.


<P> The segmentation scoring procedures based on time pointers has
the following problem.  When reference story has a duration in time,
but not in lexical tokens, the scoring program ingores that stories
boundaries.  Consequently, the denominators for calculation P(miss)
and P(fa) are slightly off (18 seconds in 260000 seconds).  Since the
discrepancy is small, and the current TDT evaluation will not be using
time pointers, this problem is left for future resolution.
