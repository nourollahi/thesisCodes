Regards your paper
Dear Prof.
I hope you are doing great. Regards your data set entitled "TDT5" that you have exploited in your paper (i.e., ""); I'm required to use this data set for scientific purposes at university of Tehran as a part of my thesis. Due to international sanctions on our country we can not have access to the data set at this moment. Could you please share this with us?
Best regards,
